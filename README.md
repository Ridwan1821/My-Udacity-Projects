# My-Udacity-Projects
This repository contains all projects I did in my Udacity Data Analytics nanodegree.
On each project, there is a datasets.zip file that contains all the datasets used for the project. 
The data analytics process of each project is done with python through jupyter notebook. Hence, a .ipynb file is present in each project folder.
Lastly, the .html version of each .ipynb file is also provided.
